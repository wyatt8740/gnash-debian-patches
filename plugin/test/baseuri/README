These files are a test for resolution of relative urls
with different mixes of <base> tags and "base" params
and subdir layouts.

The test is not automated.
You have to build test.swf in both root and sub/ dirs
(top line of test.as contains makeswf call) and install
this directory content under a 'test' directory in your
base root (or change installation in test_base.html top
lines).
Pointing your browser to the test.html file will show
instructions on how to tell if the player is working as
expected or not.

As a facility, some javascript code shows what's the supposed
baseURI to use for resolving relative urls.
