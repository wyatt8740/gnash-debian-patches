= Thumbnailer =

Thumbnailers are Nautilus specific

Up to 2.32 (Ubuntu 10.04 has 2.30.1) gconftool --makefile-install-rule
and --makefile-uninstall-rule have to be used

From 2.32 up .thumbnailer files in /usr/share/thumbnailers

16:18 < Company> strk: the thumbnailer stuff was changed for 3.0 afaik
16:18 < Company> strk: 332:http://git.gnome.org/browse/evince/tree/thumbnailer
                 is probably a good example of the new way to do a thumbnailer
16:19 < Company> strk: and
333:http://git.gnome.org/browse/evince/tree/thumbnailer?h=gnome-2-32 for the
                 old way


When producing thumbnails gnash should prevent any security issue
so forbid loading of _any_ resource, forbid using shared memory
(LocalConnection), forbid writing SharedObjects.
To reduce load, a short AS execution timeout should also be used.
All of the above can be done using a custom gnashrc, to be installed
somewhere (/etc/gnashthumbnailerrc?)
