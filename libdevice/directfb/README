The DirectFB GUI code is for running in a raw framebuffer. Currently
Gnash uses it's own framebuffer code to handle everything. Using
DirectFB would reduce the amount of code that needs to be in Gnash
that deals with devices and the framebuffer. At this time thought this
is only partially implemented, mostly to make sure the GnashDevice API
would support DirectFB if this was ever fully implemented.
