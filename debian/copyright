Copyright: 2005-2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License: GPL-3+ and GFDL-1.2+
 Source code is released under GPL-3+ license.
 Documentation in "gnash-doc" binary package is produced by extracting
 comments from source code and released under GFDL-1.2+.
 .
 Linking Gnash statically or dynamically with other modules is making
 a combined work based on Gnash. Thus, the terms and conditions of
 the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Gnash give
 you permission to combine Gnash with free software programs or
 libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and/or with Mozilla,
 so long as the linking with Mozilla, or any variant of Mozilla, is
 through its standard plug-in interface. You may copy and distribute
 such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for Gnash and the
 licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include the
 source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires
 distribution of source code.
 .
 Note that people who make modified versions of Gnash are not obligated
 to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
 their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
 permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
 exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
 carries forward this exception.
