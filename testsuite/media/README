set added using mp3info. The pp uses the set added by mp3info. If it encounters
only data written by audacity, the onID3 function is called, but the id3 object
contains no data.

audio_timewarp.flv

	A cut-down version of a stream downloaded from StreamTheWorld
	radio for bug report http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?26687

	audio frames have a timestamp difference of over an hour.
	Gnash used to wait the whole time before proceeding, which
	was wrong.
