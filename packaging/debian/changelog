  Update source for trunk build 070802 aka preview 0.8.1:
      bzr repo: https://code.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/gnash/trunk
      revno: 5534

  Redo and cleanup packaging in consequence of upstream buildsystem
  refactoring:

  * debian/rules: dropping obsolete --enable-sound and --enable-mp3 and
    the bogus --enable-static switch; fixing --enable-gui switch
  * debian/patches/series: don't apply no-kde-ldflags anymore ... applied
    upstream
  * debian/patches/series: don't apply easy-codec-install anymore ... applied
    upstream
  * debian/rules: use agg renderer
  * debian/patches/{disable-testsuite,series}: disable testsuite patch
  * debian/control: drop firefox-dev from build-depends
  * debian/patches/*: drop ming headers patch - not used
  * debian/rules: use enable-gui='gtk,kde'
  * debian/rules: dropping obsolete --enable-sound and --enable-mp3 and the
    bogus --enable-static switch; fixing --enable-gui switch
  * debian/patches/use_pkglibdir_for_unversioned_libs, debian/patches/series:
    install libs in pkglibdir instead of just libdir - as they are unversioned
  * reorganize gnash packaging to take upstream changes into account:
    all common files are now stored in pkglibdir and provided by gnash-common
    package; in turn no libgnash0 nor libklash0 package exist anymore; gui
    code is not linked into the binaries, which are provided by gnash and klash
    package respectively; since no stable lib api is provided anymore
    libgnash-dev package is now just gnash-dev (though its currently disabled
    completely).
  * debian/gnash-common.install: install those libs we need explicitly to
    prevent libgnashplugin.so from getting pulled into gnash-common package
  * debian/rules: don't run dh_makeshlibs for libgnash0 libklash0 anymore ...
    as they don't exist
  * debian/control: make gnash-common conflicts/replaces on libklash0,
    libgnash0, gnash << 0.8.1~
  * debian/gnash.manpages: remove manpages for gnash package as gnash manpage
    is now shipped in gnash-common
  * debian/TODO,debian/overrides/libgnash0,debian/overrides/libklash0:
    dropping these old/unused files from bzr.

  Support ubuntu flashplugin-alternative:
  * debian/mozilla-plugin-gnash.postinst,debian/mozilla-plugin-gnash.prerm:
    use flashplugin-alternative to i nstall plugin for browsers
  * debian/mozilla-plugin-gnash.links: remove links to plugin-host applications
    as they are now installed by alternatives
  * debian/mozilla-plugin-gnash.dirs: ensure existence of plugin host directories
